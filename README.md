## About me:

I am a second year computer science major currently studying at the University of Auckland.

I enjoy playing video games in my free time.

**Some of my favourite games are:**
* [Counter-Strike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/)
* [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)
* [Dave the Diver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/)

## **Project**:

**This project will use the following languages to create an original meme and animation:**

1. *R Markdown*
2. *HTML*
3. *CSS*

This section will also allow me to demonstrate several Markdown syntax for my first project.
