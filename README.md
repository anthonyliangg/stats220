# **Greetings!**

## About me:

I am a second year computer science major currently studying at the University of Auckland.

I enjoy playing first-person shooter games such as Counter-Strike.

### *This repo will contain my work on RStudio projects delved upon in stats220*

This project will use R markdown, HTML, and CSS to create an original meme.
